# Convert YOLOv9 Model to TensorFlow Lite


This repository provides scripts and instructions for converting a YOLO (You Only Look Once) model to TensorFlow Lite format. TensorFlow Lite is a lightweight solution for deploying machine learning models on mobile and edge devices, making it ideal for applications that require real-time object detection, such as mobile apps or embedded systems.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- OpenCV (optional, for inference and testing)
- YOLO pre-trained model weights
